# Learn-CAPL

- Communication Access Programming Language(CAPL) is a proframming language used in CANoe software.
- CAPL allows users to write scripts to simulate the behaviour of ECUs, networks nodes in a virtual environment.
- With CAPL users can create custom test scenarios, perform diagnostics, generate and analyze messages, and create interactive simulations. 
- CAPL scripts can be used to automate testing, simulate complex scenarios and perform analysis of network behavior. 

### CAPL Syntax 
1. Comments:
```
//this is a comment 
```
2. Variables
```
datatype variableName = initialValue;
int myInt = 42;
```
3. Functions: CAPL has many built-in functions that you can use in your scripts, such asóutput´c, ínput´and ´write´. You can call a functions by writing its name followed by parentheses, with any required arguments inside the parentheses.
```
output(myMessage)
write("Hello, World")
```
4. Control Structures: CAPL supports several control structures, such as if-else, while, for and switch. 
```
if(myInt == 42){
    write("The answer to the ultimate question of life");
}   else {
    write("Sorry, myInt is not 42");
}
```
5. Events: In CAPL, you can define functions that are triggered by specific events, such as when the simulation starts or stops, or when a message is received on the bus. 
```
on message 0x123 {
    //do something
}
```
