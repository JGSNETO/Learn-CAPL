# Learn-CAPL

- Communication Access Programming Language(CAPL) is a proframming language used in CANoe software.
- CAPL allows users to write scripts to simulate the behaviour of ECUs, networks nodes in a virtual environment.
- With CAPL users can create custom test scenarios, perform diagnostics, generate and analyze messages, and create interactive simulations. 
- CAPL scripts can be used to automate testing, simulate complex scenarios and perform analysis of network behavior. 
- Based on C programming language, CAPL, or Communication Access Programming Language, is the programming language used exclusively within th PC-based tool environments of CANalyzer and CANoe.
- In simples term CAPL used in CANalyzer helps monitor and control CAN traffic in a single module .
- CAPL used in CANOe helps to monitor CAN traffic of real module and synthesis of other modules present in the network.
- CAPL is a C like lnaguage. It is structured based on C.
- It has addition features related to CAN.
- CANalyzer = Single node - control.
- CANoe = Multiple Node - Control.
- Each CAPL program is a task. All task are independent. 
- Each task has its own On start and On stop event procedures. 
- Each task can have n number of timers.
- Available hardware resource are sharable among the task. Any task can access avaiable resource. 
- key board event can be used to raise event.
- CAPLS can have GUI using panels using EV variable or signal(CANoe).
- Can´t debug or step run and watch is not possible.
- Write window acts like output screen in C programs.
- Communication protocol functions for RS232 TCP/IP are readily available. Hence we can interface external devices using std network protocol. 
- CAPL is a event driven software. Triggers: Timer, Key press or Message received. 
- The execution in CAPL is synchronous.
- Event based, not interrupt driven.
- CAPl programs are created using an integrated development environment called the CAPL browser.
- Direct access to signals, system variables and diagnostic parameters.
- Able to link user created DLLs.

### CAPL Fundamentals
1. You should be familiar with the CAN protocol
2. You should be confortable using either CANalyzer or CANoe and CANdb, the CAN database editor
3. You should also be familiar with the C programming language. It is possible to learn to program in CAPL without knowing C, but the basics program structure is the same.
4. CAPL utilizes two types of files. Source code files (.CAN) and CAPL programs.
5. When you compile a .CAN file in the CAPL Browser, CANalyzer, or CANoe a binary file can only be interpreted and executed by a CANalyzer or CANoe simulation. 
### CAPL Syntax 
1. Comments:
```
//this is a comment 
```
1. Variables
```
datatype variableName = initialValue;
int myInt = 42;
```
1. Functions: CAPL has many built-in functions that you can use in your scripts, such asóutput´c, ínput´and ´write´. You can call a functions by writing its name followed by parentheses, with any required arguments inside the parentheses.
```
output(myMessage)
write("Hello, World")
```
1. Control Structures: CAPL supports several control structures, such as if-else, while, for and switch. 
```
if(myInt == 42){
    write("The answer to the ultimate question of life");
}   else {
    write("Sorry, myInt is not 42");
}
```
1. Events: In CAPL, you can define functions that are triggered by specific events, such as when the simulation starts or stops, or when a message is received on the bus. 
```
on message 0x123 {
    //do something
}
```
### CAPL program organization 
- Overaal, the organization of a CAPL program follows a similar structure to other programming languages, with header files, global variables, functions and event handlers. Understanding this basic structure can help you create well organized and effective CAPL scripts. 
  
1. Header Files: At the top of your CAPL script, you may include header files that define macros, data types, and functions that you want to use in your script. 
```
#include "CAN.h" //Include the CAN header file
#include "MyLyb.h" //Include a custom library header file
1. Global Variable Declarations: You can declare global variables that will be accessible throughout your CAPL script. 
```
int myInt = 5;//Declare a global integer variable
message myMessage; // Declare a global message variable
```
1. Functions: You can define functions that perform specific tasks in your CAPL script. 
```
void sendMyMessage() {
    myMessage.id =0x123;
    myMessage.dlc=8;
    output(myMessage);
}
```
1. Event Procedures: You can define event handler functions that will be called when specific events occur in the CANoe simulation environment.
```
on start {
    write("Simulation started.");
}

on timer 100 {
    sendMyMessage();
}
```
4. Main funtions: Finally, you may define a main functions that is called when the simulation starts. This function typically includes initialization code and starts any necessary timers or 
event handlers. 
```
```
void main() {
    write("Starting simulation...");
    setTimer(1, 100); // start a timer to send messages every 100ms
}
```

### Important differences from C

- Function overloading is allowed
- The "this" keyword 
- Local variables are static(Assigned only once and retains its value)
- Dynamic memory and the elCount() function
- Variables are assigned a default value implicitly
- Run-time error handling 

### CAPL equivalents to C functions

C Function - CAPL Function - Notes
sizeof - elCount - sizeof has no exact equivalent 
sprintf - snprintf - Similar string formatting parameters used
printf - write - Similar string formatting parameters used

### Declaration

char letter = "a";
message wakeup xxx;
int j,k = 2, 0 ;

```
includes{

}

variables {
    int a =10;
    int b = 25;
    message ACCInfo _mAccInfo;
}

on start{
    write("Welcome to CAPL programming");
    settimer(one_sec,1);
}

on time one_sec {
    write("Value of letter_a = %c", letter_a);
    wirte("Number of days in a year = %d", number_days_in_year);
    _maAccInfo.byte(0)=0x11;
    output(_mAccInfo);
}
```

### Initialization

- In contrast to standard C, the compiler initializes all numeric variables to 0 and all string-type variables to null. 
- All message-type variables in CAPL are usually initialized to the transmit request state with its data field defaulted to 0. 
- The state represents the direction of transmission before the message is transmitted. 
- Timer-type variables, on the other hand, are not automatically initializaed and do not need to be initialized. 

### Local Variables 

- One important difference in CAPL when compared to C is that local variables are always declared statically. 
- This means that they are initialized only once. 
- The first time the event procedure or user-defined functions is executed. 
- When variables enter the procedure, they assume the value they had at the end of the previous execution of the procedure. 

```
void myFunc(){
    byte value = 10; //Static called once
    write("Valur = %d", value);
    ...
    value =35;
}
```

### Static memory: C x CAPL

- In C programming language, static memory refers to a type of memory allocation where the memory is allocated at compile-time and persists throughout the entire execution of the program. The static memory is allocates in a region of memory separate from the stack and heap, and its contents are initialized to zero by default. 
- Static memory in C is used to store global variables, which can be accessed by any function within the program. Static variables can also be used inside functions, but their values persists between function calls, unlike automatic variables which are allocated on the stack and are destroyed when the function returns. 
- In CAPL, which is a scripting language used for developing test applications in the automotive industry, static memory has a slightly different meaning. In CAPL, static variables are used to store values that should persist between functions calls, just like in C. However, in CAPL, all variables are static by default, which means that they persist between function calls and their values are preserved across function boundaries. This is a different from C, where automatic variables are allocated on the stack and are destroyed when the function returns. 
- The main difference between static memory in C and CAPL is that in C, static memory is used to store global variables and can be used inside functions to preserve their value between calls, whereas in CAPL, all variable are static by default and persist between function calls. 

### Type casting

- CAPL supports type casting. There are times when you want to conver the value of a variables of one data type to another data type for purposes of evaluating an expression. There are two ways to do this in CAPL, both of which are the same as in C. 

```
int sum;

sum = (int) 1.6 + (int) 1.7;
``` 

### Arrays
- Another type of variables used in CAPL is an array, a collection of data items that all have the same name.
- Individual data items within an array must all be of the same type.
- The array name is always followed by square brackets that contain either the array size for a declaration statement or an index value to specify the data location within the array.
- Each of the individual elements in an array ia ccessed by an integer index. When numbering the elements of an array, the first element is always the number 0.
- CAPL supports the following type of arrays:
1. Integer arrays
2. Character arrays
3. One-dimensional arrays
4. Multi-dimensional arrays

```
int values[5]={0xA1, 0X23, 0X3F, 0X98, 0X45};
char ECU_name[10] = "BCM";
char bus_type[3] = {'C','A','N'};
```
### Main CAPL functions
1. on start: This functions is called when the simulation or test module starts
```
on start{
    write("Simulation started");
}
2. on stop: This functions is called when the simulation or test module stops
```
on stop{
    write("Simulation Stopped");
}
```
3. on timer: This functions is called periodically at specified time interval
```
on timer (100){
    output(0x123, "Hello, World");
}
```
4. on key: This function is called when a specific key is pressed on the keyboard
```
on key 'a'{
    write("Key 'a' was pressed);
}
```
5. on sysvar: This functions is called when a system variable is changed
on sysvar TIMER_ENABLED{
    if(TIMER_ENABLED ==1){
        write("Timer is enabled");
    }else{
        write("Timer is disabled");
    }
}
```
6. output: This functions is used to send a message on the CAN bus
```
output(0x123, "Hello, World");
```
7. getSignal: This functions is used to read the value of a signal in a message
```
int value = getSignal(CAN_MESSAGE::SIGNAL_NAME);
```
8. setSignal: This function is used to set the value of a signal in a message
```
setSignal(CAN_MESSAGE::SIGNAL_NAME, 0x123);
```
9.  getEnvVar: This function is used to read the value of an environment variable
```
int value = getEnvVar("ENV_VAR_NAME");
```
11. setEnvVar: This functions is used to set the value of an environment variable
```
setEnvVar("ENV_VAR_NAME", 123);
```
12. getLastError: This function is used to get the description of the last error that occurred in the CAPL script
```
int error = getLastError();
write("Error: " + error + "\n");
```
13. write: This function is used to write messages to the CAPL output window
```
write("This is a message\n");
```

### Branching Statements 

- Branching statements in computer programming allow the program to alter its flow of execution based on certain conditions or criteria. The most common brnching statements are "if", "else", "else if", "switch" and "case". 

``` 
float MPH = 70.0;
float speed;
float cruising_speed;

if(speed >= MPH) cruising_speed = speed;
```

```
includes{

}

variables{
    int set_speed;
    int vehiclespeed;
}

//Can message
on message ICM_Info{
    switch(this.CruiseSwitchrequest){
        case 0x1:
            setSignal(ACCInfo::ACCState, 2); // Set system state to standby;
            break;
        case 0x2: 
            setSignal(ACCInfo::ACCState,3); /* Signal name ACCState in a message defined in a file called ACCInfo*/
            if(getSignal(ACCInfo::ACCState)== 0x3){
                set_speed = vehiclespeed;
                setSignal(ACCInfo::TargetSpeed, set_speed); //Target is a signal
            }
            break;
    }
}

on key 's' {
    write("Set speed is %d", set_speed);
}
on message BCMInfo{
    vehiclespeed = this.VehicleSpeed;

}

```

### Control flow 

1. If statement: Allows you to conditionally execute code based on a specified condition
```
if(x > 10){
write("X is greater than 10\n");
}
```
2. If else statement: Allows you to execute one block of code if a condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false.
```
if(x>10){
    write("X is greater than 10");
}else {
    write("X is less than or equal to 10\n");
}
```
3. Switch statement: Allows you to execute dfferent blocks of code depending on the value of an expression.
```
switch (x) {
  case 1:
    write("x is 1\n");
    break;
  case 2:
    write("x is 2\n");
    break;
  default:
    write("x is neither 1 nor 2\n");
    break;
}
```
4. For loop: Allows you to execute a block of code multiple times, based on a specified condition.
```
for(int i = 0; i<10; i++){
    write("i = " + i + "\n");
}
```
5. While loop: Allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly, as long as a specified condition is true.
```
int i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  write("i = " + i + "\n");
  i++;
}
```
6. do while loop: Allows you to execute a block of code at least once, and then repeatedly execute it as long as a specified condition is true. 
```
int i = 0;
do {
  write("i = " + i + "\n");
  i++;
} while (i < 10);
```
7. break statement: Allows you to exit a loop prematurely, based on a specified condition.
```
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i == 5) {
    break;
  }
  write("i = " + i + "\n");
}
```
8. continue statement: Allows you to skip over the current iteration of a loop, based on a specified condition.
```
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i == 5) {
    continue;
  }
  write("i = " + i + "\n");
}
```
### This Keyword

- In the CAPL programming language, "this" is a keyword that refers to the current object instance. An object instance is an occurrence of a class in memory, and "this" allows you to reference the specific instance that the current method or functions is operating on. 
- When you define a method or functions in CAPL, you can use "this" keyword as a reference to the current object instance. For example, consider the following class definition:

```
class MyClass{
    int x;
    void setX(int newX){
        this.x = newX;
    }
};
```
- In this example, "this" is used to refer to the current instance of the "MyClass", and the "setX" method sets the value of the "x" member variable for that instance.
- Using "this" is particularly useful in object-oriented programming, as it allows you to distinguish between member variables or methods that belong to the current object instance and those that belong to the class as a whole. By using "this", you can ensure that your code operates on the correct instance of an object, even if there are multiple instances of the same class in memory.

### user defined functions x Function Overloading 

- In CAPL, a user-defined function is similar to a function defined in the C programming language. A function call is possible in any CAPL event procedure. These functions can contain any legal CAPL code, and are globally accessible. Putting frequently used code in a function makes programs more efficient and organized. 

```
includes{
    #include "UserDefineFunctions.cin"; // File user developed 
}
```

- Function overloading is allowed.
- Functons overloading is a feature in programing languages that allows a function to have the same name but different parameters. This means that multiple functions with the same name can exist within the same program, as long as they have a different number or type of parameters.
- When a functions is called, the compiler or interpreter determines which version of the function to use based on the arguments passed to it. If there is a function with the exact number and types, that functions is used. If not, the compiler or interpreter will try to find a function that can accept the arguments by performing implicit conversions, such as converting an integer to a floating point number.
- Function overloading can be useful for crating functions that perform similar task but operate on different types of data or have different parameter requiremetns.
```
void printme(double num){
    write("Floating point %f", num);
}

void printme( int num){
    write("Floating %d", num);
}
```

### Logging Function 

1. setLogFileName: Sets the name of the log file
2. setPostTrigger: Sets the posttrigger time for logging 
3. setPreTrigger: Sets the pretrigger time for logging 
4. startLogging: Triggers a logging block to stat logging 
5. stopLogging: Triggers a logging block to stop logging
6. trigger: Starts all logging blocks to a log
7. writeToLog: Writes a formatted string to the log file with time stamp
8. writeToLogEx: Writes a formatted string to the log file without time stamp

```
//Start automatically
on sysvar startlogging{
    char path[200];
    if(@this){
        sysGetVariableString(sysvar::Logfilepath, path, elCount(path));
        setLogFileName(path);
        startLogging();
    }
}

//Stops execution
on sysvar stoplogging{
    if(@this){
        stopLogging();
    }
}

on message BCMInfo{
    if(this.VehicleSpeed >240){
        writeToLog("Danger!!");
    }
}
```

3. snprintf: Creates a formatted string
4. strlen: Gets the length of a string
5. strncat: Concatenates two strings
6. strncmp: Compares two strings
7. strncpy: Copies a string

### Measurement Control Functions

- In CAPL, measurement control functions are used to interact with and control the measurement and logging capabilities of the CANoe or CANalyzer tool. These functions allow you to start, stop and control the recording of measurement data during a simulation or the session. The measurement control functions provide flexibility and control over the measurement and logging capabilities of the CANoe or CANalyzer tool, allowing you to precisely manage when and how measurement data is recorded during your simulation or test scenarios.  
  
- startMeasurement(): This function starts the measurement process. It begins recording measurement data according to the configuration set in the measurement setup.

- stopMeasurement(): This function stops the measurement process. It ceases the recording of measurement data.

- startMeasurementAll(): This function starts all configured measurements. It is used when you have multiple measurement configurations defined and you want to start all of them at once.

- stopMeasurementAll(): This function stops all running measurements. It is used to stop all active measurements in a scenario.

- restartMeasurement(): This function stops the measurement and then starts it again. It can be used to reset the measurement process and start recording from the beginning.

- setMeasurementMode(): This function sets the measurement mode to a specified value. The measurement mode determines how measurement data is recorded and processed. Common modes include continuous measurement, event-triggered measurement, and time-triggered measurement.

- setMeasurementTrigger(): This function sets a trigger condition for the measurement. The measurement will start or stop based on the specified trigger condition.

- enableMeasurement() and disableMeasurement(): These functions enable or disable a specific measurement defined in the measurement setup. It allows you to selectively control which measurements are active during a simulation or test.

getMeasurementState(): This function returns the current state of the measurement. It can be used to determine if the measurement is running, stopped, or in a different state.
1. ILControlStart: Connect Node to the bus
2. ILControlStop: Remove Node from the bus
3. canOffline: Disconnects nodes from bus (CANoe´s simulation setup window only)
4. canOnline: Reconnects node to the bus(CANoe´s simulation setup window only)
5. getBusContext: Returns current bus context(CANoe´s simulation setup window only)
6. getBusNameContext: Returns a specific bus context(CANoes´s simulation setup window only)
7. getStartdelay: Gets delay time value of current node(CANoe´s Simulation setup window only)
8. halt: halts the simulation(Only possible in the simulated mode of canoe)
9. Inspect: Updates the variables in the inspect pane of the write window(CANoe only)
10. setBuscontext: Sets new context of current bus (CANoe simulation setup window only)
11. setStartdelay: Sets delay time value of present node (CANoe simulation setup window only)
12. stop: Stops the measurement

### WriteEx()

- Writes the text into the last line of the specified window or into a tab of the write window without previously creating a new line.

- Window or tab of the write window 
- -3: trace window
- -2: trace window for logging output
- -1: reserved 
- 0: output to the system tab of the write window 
- 1: output to the CAPL tab to the write window
- 4: output to the test tab of the write window
  
- Type of message for output in the write window
- 0: success
- 1: information
- 2: warning
- 3: error

### Replay block and automation functions

- ReplayResume: Resumes replaying log file after it was suspended 
- ReplayStart: Starts replaying log file from the beginning 
- ReplayState: Returns the state the replay block is in
- ReplayStop: Stops replaying log file
- ReplaySuspend: Suspend replaying log file 

### Environment variable and Panel functions

### CAPL Data Types 

- 8-bit: byte, char
- 16-bit: int, word
- 32-bit: dword, long
- 64-bit(floating point): float, double
- object: msTimer, Timer, message, pg

```

int j, k =2;
double x =33.7;
char p;
//Array declaration
long data[10];
int vector[5]= {0,1,2,3,4};
int matrix[2][4]={ {2,4,6,8}, {1,3,5,7}};
char userName[10] = "Jack Beam";
```

### The Timer and msTimer Objects

- Since CAPL is designed to provide and event-driven environment, timers provide an easy way to cause periodic events.
- CAPL allows an infinie number of user-defined timers that can be set.
- Using units of second (Timer) or milliseconds (msTimer).
- Timers are set using the setTimer function and canceled using cancelTimer functions. The most common way to set up a periodic timer is to set the timer in the initialization (or "on Start") function, set up an event based on this timer to perform a given task, and then reset the timer at the end of this task.
```
Timer t1; // Units of seconds
setTimer(t1,60); // Set to one minute
msTimer t2; // Units of milliseconds
setTimer(t2, 100); // Set to one tenth of a second
```

### Declaring messages in CAPL

- They must be declared like variables, before they can be used
- Messages can be specified in two ways: Either in an associated database or in a CAPL program itself. Declaring a message specified in an associated database is easy. Just use the symbolic name of the message.

```
message EngineTemp eTemp;
message EngineStatus eStat1, eStat2;
message 411info; //Message ID 411 (Decimal)
message 0xF2 windowStatus; // Message ID F2 (hex)
message 142x doorStatus; //Extended CAN message ID 142
message *userdefined // User defined message generic declaration
message 0xff rearAxle = {DLC=4};
```

- In CAPL you can declare messages using the 'message' keyword followed by the message declaration syntax. 
```
message MyMessage{
    using int ID; //it is an unsigned integer field that represents the message ID. It can hold values from 0 to 4294967295
    byte data[8]; // It is an array of bytes with a size of 8. This field represents the message data payload
}

on key 's'{
    MyMessage msg;
    msg.ID = 0x123;
    msg.data[0] = 0xAA;

    output(msg);
}
```
### Physical Values x Raw Value

- Physical Value: The physical value repreents the actual real-world value or measurement associated with a specific signal or data parameter. It is the value that has meaningful interpretation in the context of the application or system. For example, in the case of a temperature sensor, the physical value could represent the temperature in degrees celsius or harenheit. 
- Raw value: The raw value, also knows as the encoded or bit-level value, refers to the actual binary data that is transmitted or received over the communication network. It represents the value as it is encoded and formatted according to the communication protocol or data format being used. The raw value typically consistis of a sequence of bits that need to be decoded or processed to obtain the physical value. 
- In CAPL, you can often access both the physical value and raw value of signals or data parameters. The raw value is typically obtained directly from the communication network, while the physicial value is derived from the raw value using decoding, scaling or conversion techniques based on the specific data format and signal definition. 


```
//Physical Value
on key 'f'{
    setSignal(ECMInfo::FuelLevel, 2.5);
}

//Raw Value

on key 'r'{
    ILSetSignalRaw(ECMInfo::FuelLevel, 25);
}

### Message Selectors 

- In CAPL, a message selector is used to filter and process specific CAN messages based on their priorities, such as the identifier(ID), DLC(Data Length Code), or data content. The message selector allows you to define conditions to selectively process incoming CAN message. The message selector is typically used with the 'on message' event in CAPL, which is triggered when a CAN message is received. Here is an example of using a message selector in CAPL:
```
on message CAN_Message msg{
    if(msg.id == 0x123 && msg.dlc==8){
        //process the can message with ID 0x123 and DLC 8
        //Your code here
    }
}
```
- By using message selectors, you can filter and process specific CAN message of interest enabling you to control the behaviour of your CAPL program based on the message properties. 

Selector - Description - Valid Values

- ID: Message Identifier: Any valid CAN message ID
- CAN: Chip number: 1 or 2
- DLC: Data length Code: 0 to 8
- DIR: Direction of transmission: RX(Received); TX(Transmit); TXREQUEST(Transmit Request)
- RTR: Remote TransmissionRequest: 0(not an RTR); 1(RTR)
- TYPE: Combination of DIR and RTR: See below
- TIME: Time stamp of the message in units of 10ms(Read only): Long integer
- SIMULATED: Sent by a simulated node: 0(real node); 1(simulated node)

### Environment Variable Functions

- In CAPL, there are several functions avaiable for working with environment variables. Environment variables are system-lvel variables that store information about the environment in which a program is executed. CAPL provides functions to access and manipulate these variables. 

1. 'getenv()': This function is used to retrieve the value of an environment variable. It takes the name of the environment variable as an argment and returns the corresponding value as a string. 
```
variables:
    char* value;
on start:
    value = getenv("HOME");
    write("Home directory: ", value);
``` 
2. 'putenv()': This function is used to set or modify the value of an environment variable. it takes a string argument in the format "variable=value" and updates the corresponding environment variable with the specified value. 
```
on start:
    putenv("MY_VARIABLE=my_value");
```
3. 'unsetend()': This function is used to unset or remove an environment variable. It takes the name of the environment variable as an argument and removes it from the environment. 
```
on start:
    unsetenv("MY_VARIABLE");
```

- These functions allow you to interact with environment variables within your CAPL scripts. They can be useful for accessing system-related information, configuration settings, or passing data between different software components. Make sure to refer to the CAPL documentation for detailed information on these functions and their usage. 

### Built in Constants 

- CAPL provides some built-in constant values for use in your programs. Some of them only are used in specific cases.
- However, you might find the PI constant useful. It contains the value of a pi to the maximum.
- Also, the constants LPT1, LPT2 and LPT3 can be used in the place of port addresses for the import() and output() functions. 

### Events in CAPL

- CAPL is an event-driven language. This means that sections of a program are executed in response to specific occurences(Events) rather than the whole program being executed all at once. 
- In CAPL, an event procedure is associated with every event that is important to the application. 
- On message: More detail more priority
```
on message CAN1.0x123{

}

on message 0x123{

}

on message * {

}

```

### Protocol Layer block placement in measurement setup


- In the context of CANoe from Vector, the P box refers to the Protocol Layer Block. It is a configuration block used to define the communication protocols and message formats for simulating or testing various network protocols in a simulated environment.
- The P block allows you to specify the network protocols, such as CAN, LIN, FlexRay, Ethernet, etc. and configure their parameters, including message identifiers, data formats, signal definitions, and transmission/reception behavior. It provides an interface for defining the communication behavior of simulated ECUs or network nodes.
- By configuring the P block, you can define the messages and signals that are transmitted and received on the simulated network, allowing you to simulate various communication scenarios and test the behavior of your system under different network conditions. 
- The P block is an essential component of CANoe, as it enables the simulation and testing of different network protocols and the exchenge of message between ECUs or network nodes. It provides a high level of flexibility and control over the communication behaviour, allowing you to design and execute comprehensive test for your system. 

### Program Block
- Program block are included in Measurement.
- Want our own block to analyze the traffic 
- In CANoe, a program block is a powerful feature tat allows you to extend the functionality of the tool by writing custom scripts. Program blocks are written in CAPL(Communication Access Programming Language), which is a scripting language specific to Vecto CANoe. 
- Program blocks can be used to perform various tasks, such as simulating complex network behavior, implementing custom diagnostics, generating dynamic test cases, and more. They provide a way to automate and customize the behavior of the CANoe environemnt.
 ```
 void MyProgramBlock(){
    write("Hello, CANoe!");
 }

```
- In the above example, the program block is defined as a function named "MyProgramBlock()". Within this function, you can write your custom code. In this case, it simply writes the message "Hello, CANoe" to the write window.
- Program blocks can be executed in different ways, such as automatically at startup, triggered by specific events, or called from other program blocks or panels. They can access and manipulate simulation variables, send and receive messages on the bus, interact with the user interface and much more. 
- To create a program nlock in CANoe, you typically follow these steps:
1. Open your CANoe configuration
2. Go to "Configuration" menu and select "programs"
3. In the program editor, write you CAPL code
4. Save the program block with an appropriate name and extension
5. Optionally, configure the program block execution setting, such as startup behaviour or event triggers
6. Build and start the simulation to execute the program block

- Remember that program blocks in CANoe are highly customizable and can be as simple or complex as you need them to be. The CAPL language provides a wide range of functions and features to interact with the CANoe environment and simulate various scenarios.
